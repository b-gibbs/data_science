# Data Projects

A collection of notes and exercises created in connection with the Data Science Career Track program at Springboard.com.

All of these projects (and more!) can be found at my site: https://thegyre.io

- __JSON Project__: a short exploratory data analysis project using data from the World Bank to look at development projects around the world.
- __Statistical Inference__: three short projects exploring EDA and graphical EDA, hypothesis testing, Z-tests and t-tests.
- __Machine Learning__:  four short machine learning projects.
- __prj01_NFL_DB__ :  a classification project to predict which NCAA defensive backs will play at least three years in the NFL.
