    "Features to examine:\n",
    "This one might be tricky.  I'm interested in looking at the effects high-frequency trading has on market movements.  Many of these algorithms have a component that looks at the 'physics' of price changes -- the direction and the momentum of the movement.  This has the effect of piling on or emphasizing gains and losses beyond what a rational individual would indicate looking at the actual health of the markets, companies and industries."
