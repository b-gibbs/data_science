Since this is so closely related to the definition of an adopted user, it's not surprising that the two are highly correlated. This is still a useful bit of information.  The company could send tickler emails or find other ways to encourage users login, particularly within the days immediately following account creation.  The second most important feature, by a wide margin, is the gap in days between account creation and initial login."
