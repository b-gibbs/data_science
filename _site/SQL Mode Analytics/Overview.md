## A drop in user engagement

The hypothetical situation states that Yammer is concerned about a sudden drop in user engagement that occurred beginning in August of 2014.  To investigate the cause(s) for the drop in user anome up with a list of possible causes for the dip in retention shown in the chart above. Make a list and determine the order in which you will check them. Make sure to note how you will test each hypothesis. Think carefully about the criteria you use to order them and write down the criteria as well.  Active users are users that have engaged on the platform at least once in a given week.

### Hypotheses
There are several possible explanations for the drop in user engagement that are worth exploring.  The actual cause is likely some combination of the following:

1.  __Vacation__: The month of the drop in user engement was August.  August is a month that many, particularly in Europe and the US, take vacation.  Since Yammer is a corporate tool, it stands to reason that engagement would drop when a large percentage of employees are on vacation.  The greatest number of active users are in Europe and the US.  

2.  __Insignificant__:  The drop in active users was slight from July to August, and the number of active users is higher in August 2014 than it was in June 2014.  

3.  __Technology Change__:  It could be that one or more companies decided to switch to a competing technology.  The more employees those companies had as active Yammer users, the bigger the impact that would have on Yammer engagement, overall.  Seven companies have more than 100 Yammer users, the rest typically have fewer than 50.  If one of these large companies switched to a competitor and required all of their employees to switch, it would have a serious impact on the total number of active users.
